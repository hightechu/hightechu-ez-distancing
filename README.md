## EZ Distancing is a Social Distancing Smart Phone Case Prototype currently in development.
This Arduino project uses 2 Passive Infared Sensors (PIR) and 2 Ultrasonic Distance Sensors to detect if another person is within the users 2 meter social distancing bubble. If the device detects that a person is within a 2 meter radius of the user, it will alert them, letting them know that they should move away to maintain social distancing. If the person is maintaining their social distancing, it will let them know that they are the recommended distance away from others.

## Component Usage

- Arduino Uno:
Microcontroller that will be handling all of the code, data, and inputs/outputs


- OLED Screen:
To give the user different text based alerts


- Distance Sensors:
Ultrasonic sensor that measures distance from 2cm - 400cm


- Motion Sensors:
Passive Infrared Sensor that measures 6 to 7 meters at 110 degrees

- Vibration Motor:
Vibration to physically alert the user 


- LED:
Light to visually alert the user
